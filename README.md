# Glacier Frontend

This is the new frontend for [Glacier](https://github.com/alexmoras/glacier). It's a rework of the original and actually
follows the development standards (unlike the original).

This frontend is now in a separate repository, it didn't make sense to keep developing the backend and frontend all in
the same repository.

## Features
- Vuetify.js layout/design
- Vue-Router single page application
- Progressive Web Application
- Vuex state store (save API requests)
